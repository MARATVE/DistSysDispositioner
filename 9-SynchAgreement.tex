        \frametitle{Synchronous Broadcast: The Goal}
            With synchronous broadcast, we are trying to solve an agreement problem. We are looking for the following properties
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Agreement}: All honest parties make the same decision
                \item \textbf{Validity}: The decision must be sensible in some sensible
                \item \textbf{Termination}: If all parties start running the protocol, then all honest parties must end up with some decision
            \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Synchronous Agreement}  
        And we are looking at the following agreement problems:
        \textbf{Broadcast}: The sender $S$ sends a single message. All receivers a message or NoMsg and agree on an output. If $S$ is honest, then only the message can be output as coming from $S$. If $S$ is honest, no one outputs NoMsg. 
        
        \textbf{Byzantine Agreement}: There are $n$ parties $P_1, ..., P_n$. Each has bit $b_i$ as input. They output a common decision bit $d$. All parties should agree on $d$. If all parties have the same input, they should all agree. 
\end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Definition of broadcast}
            There are $n$ parties. $P_1, ..., P_n$. One sends message $m$ to all the other parties. We are looking for \textit{agreement, validity, termination}.
