%===================================
\begin{document}
	\section{Key Distribution Centers}
		\frame{\frametitle{Key Distribution Problems}
			Public key cryptography depends on the distribution of keys. Everyone having to store everyone else's keys scales badly. One way to solve this problem is by having centralised databases of keys. These are called \textit{Key Distribution Centers} or (KDC). 
		}

		\frame{\frametitle{Key Distribution Centers}
			Key Distribution Centers have the following properties
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Based on Secret-Key Systems
				\item Every user shares $K_A$ with the KDC
				\item When A wants to talk to B, KDC generates $E_{K_A}(K)$ for A, $E_{K_B}(K)$ for B. 
				\item All users must trust KDC completely
				\item If the KDC is down or compromised, the entire network is f√•kked. 
			\end{itemize}
		}

	\section{Certification Authorities}
			\frame{\frametitle{Certification Authorities}
				We can replace the previous example with the following protocol
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Key $K_{AB}$ is replaced by pair $(sk_B, pk_B)$. Here $pk_B$ is public. 
					\item A sends session key $E_{pk_B}(K)$ to B. 
				\end{itemize}
				How do we distribute these? Assume we have a \textit{Certification Authority} CA with the pair $(sk_{CA}, pk_{CA})$. Everyone then gets a copy of $pk_{CA}$. Then begins the hard part of authenticating yourself with the CA. This might even be done in person. The CA then issues cert $ID_A$, and $pk_A$ and then the signature $S_{sk_{CA}}(ID_A, pk_A)$. Now everyone can check to see if the public key is legitimate. 
			}

			\frame{\frametitle{Certificate Chains: Or Who Verifies The Verifiers}
				If two people do not have certificates issued from the same CA, they can use what's called Certificate Chains to solve this problem. If CA's certifiy each other's public keys. 
				If user $A$ has $CA_1$ and $B$ has $CA_2$. If $A$ receives $Cert_{CA_2}(B, pk)$ then if he also gets $Cert_{CA_1}(CA_2, pk_{CA_2})$ then $A$ can verify that certificate. A chain has the from
				$$
					Cert_{CA_1}(B, pk_B), Cert_{CA_2}(CA_1, pk_{CA_1}).....
				$$
				It should be noted that this requires one to trust the initial part of the chain in the first place. 
			}

		\section{How to identify users}
				\frame{\frametitle{Who they are? Biometric Security}
					Biometric Security is when a system makes use of fingerprints, voice, facial recognition and other biological factors unique to an individual to identify them. This has a privacy downsides, and if the information is leaked, it could still be used to attack systems. 
				}

				\frame{\frametitle{Something They Have: Hardware Security}
					Hardware may have their own keys, such as for RSA encryption, which is only accessible through the CPU. It is also possible to make \textit{tamper evident} hardware, which can tell if it has been tampered with. 
					\textbf{Two-factor authentication}: Two-factor authentication works by demanding that the user authenticate themselves not only with a password, but also by possession of a piece of hardware, such as a smartphone. This means that even if the password is compromised, it is still possible to deny intruders access. 
				}

				\frame{\frametitle{Password Security}
				Passwords identity users from what they know. And generally we want to protect passwords from the following 4 attacks
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The adversary can guess and verify their guesses
					\item The password is transmitted in an insecure manner, and the adversary can intercept it
					\item The password is stored in an insecure manner, and can be stolen from the user
					\item The password can be stolen from the verifier
				\end{itemize}				
			}

			\frame{\frametitle{Password security}
				The previously listed problems can be remedied with the following:
				\textbf{Guessing passwords}: This can be remedied with password rules. However, the more password rules, the fewer combinations people have to guess. Having ample length and characters (but mostly length) and a database of vulnerable passwords that are forbidden seems to be the best policy
				\textbf{Insecure Transmission}: Use encryption
				\textbf{Insecure storage by the user}: Could be helped by using other forms of authentication, such as two-factor authentication.  
				\textbf{Stealing from verifier}: Salt and hash passwords, store them encrypted and use good security policies.
